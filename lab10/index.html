					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation by using JavaScript and jQuery to 
						make a button that generates random Lorem Ipsum text when pushed and then display it.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not have many problems with this lab until we got to the bonus task. It took a while to figure out 
						how to get the text user was inputting to appear on the right side of the screen without it looking weird or messing up the format.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was useful as it allowed us to experiment with DOM manipulation and learn 
						how to generate random sets of text. It also allowed us to learn how to use jQuery to have users input 
						text as well as how to make inline block elements appear on the right side of the screen.
					</p>

				<p>Why don't you press the button and find out yourself. (OuO)</p>
