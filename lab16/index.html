			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to use AJAX to connect to an API and process 
						JSON from it so we can display parts of it on our webpage.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem we experienced was the XKCD API that we were originally 
						going to use was causing some errors, so we switched to the 
						NASA APOD API since it didn't have the same issue.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After our initial struggles with the XKCD API, we were able to fairly 
						smoothly make the JS for this lab based on what we did in 
						class. It allowed us to learn connect to APIs and get and 
						display the specific JSON data we want using the data. function. 
						By adding the count: 1 to data section of the AJAX request, we were able
						to pull a random picture of the day.
					</p>
