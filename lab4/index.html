			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab had us thinking of lists for how to do an every task and how to make a rock-paper-scissors game on the computer. Then, we created pseudocode for these tasks. The lecture for pseudocoding was very helpful in showing us the process.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not have many problems with this lab. The only minor issues we had were making sure the formatting of our lists was right and coming up with all the steps we would need to take to make pizza and a rock-paper-scissors game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab helped us familiarize ourselves with the process of pseudocoding, which will let us better plan out code in the future. We had to think very hard about what steps we would need to put on the lists. We also learned how to center an image on the page with CSS by looking at w3schools.com</p>

						// How to make pizza:
						     // Gather ingredients (pizza dough, pizza sauce, cheese, toppings)
						     // Preheat the oven 475°F
						     // Prepare a baking sheet
						     // Prepare the dough
						         // Flour the surface
						         // Roll/Stretch the dough
						         // Place the dough on a baking sheet 
						     // Add sauce & cheese 
						         // Spread a layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough
						         // Sprinkle a layer of cheese on top of the sauce
						     // Add toppings
						         // Evenly distribute the chosen toppings over the cheese
						     // Bake the pizza
						         // Place the pizza in the preheated oven
						         // Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the pizza looks ready
						     // Finish up to serve
						         // Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool
						         // Cut the pizza into slices
						         // Serve the pizza

						// Creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game vs. computer, best of three:
						     //Initialize the game
						     //Accept player input/Generate computer move
						         //Prompt player to choose between “rock”, “paper”, or “scissor”
						         //Computer program randomly selects between “rock”, “paper”, or “scissor”
						     //Determine the outcome
						         //Compare the player’s choice with the computer’s
						         //Apply the rules
							         //Rock beats scissors
							         //Scissors beat paper
							         //Paper beats rock
						         //Determine if the player won, lost or tied against the computer
						     //Display the result
						         //Announce the computer’s choice
						         //Print "The winner is"
						         //Add one point to winner, no points if draw
						     //Test of win or draw condition
						         //Repeat from Step 2 until player/computer wins 2 out of 3 rounds
						         //Prompt the player to play another set or quit
